# ybs-flickr-challenge

Hello YBS! Thank you for handing me this challenge and taking the time to review it. Hopefully I have managed to complete all of the objectives to a good standard. I've built this app using SwiftUI with an MVVM architecture as this is what I've worked with before and I believe I was told during my interview YBS also use this so I thought it would be appropriate.

The app should be able to just be cloned and should build with no issues. I have chosen to use the TagCloud swift package (https://github.com/yarspirin/TagCloud) out of convenience as a flexible solution to wrapping dynamically sized HStack contents (photo tags) to a new line as this was complicated with the time available.

I look forward to hearing from you soon,

Kind regards,

James Buckley
